This demo repo contains a React app with a suite of tests. You don't need to do anything with the app itself. 

On the main branch, the config needs some improvement. The three jobs are running exactly the same suite of tests, but on a different version of Node each time.

What improvements would make the code more efficient and speed up the workflow?
